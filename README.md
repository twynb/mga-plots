# MobileGeometricAudio plots

this is just a simple script to create the plots used in my [my bachelor thesis](https://github.com/twynb/BachelorThesis)
from data generated by [the proof-of-concept](https://github.com/twynb/MobileGeometricAudioDemo).

The data used can be found in the `data` directory and was generated from the proof-of-concept repository using the `run_all_tests.sh` script.
